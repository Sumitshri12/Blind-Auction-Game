# Blind Auction

This is a simple Blind Auction program written in Python. It determines the highest bidder without revealing bids until the end.

## How to Use

1.  Run the `blind_auction.py` file.
2.  Enter your name and bid.
3.  Answer whether there are other bidders.
4.  If there are, the screen clears for the next bidder.
5.  If not, the winner is announced.
